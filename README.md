# 🧠 Neural Network from Scratch in NumPy

This project implements a fully functioning feedforward neural network from the ground up — **without using any deep learning libraries** like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Just pure NumPy.

It includes:
- Dense layers (fully connected)
- ReLU and Softmax activations
- Categorical Cross-Entropy loss
- Forward pass for multi-class classification using synthetic spiral data

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Built from scratch using NumPy
- ✅ Layered, class-based architecture
- ✅ Clean and modular file structure
- ✅ End-to-end forward pass logic
- 🚧 Backpropagation planned in future (in a separate repo)

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/varunxsensei/neural_network_from_scratch.git
   cd neural_network_from_scratch/nn_numpy
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python dense_layers_with_activation.py
   ```

You’ll see the output of the network after the ReLU and Softmax activations, as well as the calculated loss.
