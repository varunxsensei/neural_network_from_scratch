dot_product.py

This file contains a simple function to calculate the output of a neural network layer using:
    output = input â€¢ weights + bias

It's a basic operation used in fully connected layers where we multiply the input with the weights 
and add the bias.

Example usage:
    from dot_product import compute_output
    out = compute_output(inputs, weights, bias)

# A simple example of a dot product operation with a bias added.
# This simulates the output of a single neuron in a neural network layer.

"""
Simulates the output of a fully connected neural network layer with 3 neurons.

Each neuron:
- Takes 4 inputs
- Has its own weights and bias
- Produces an output by performing a dot product with the inputs and adding its bias

The final output is a list with one value per neuron.
